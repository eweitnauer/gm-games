# GM Games
Little algebra game prototypes based on Graspable Math.

Try GM Missile Command [here](https://graspablemath.com/missile-command).

This is a collection of game prototypes that use the [Graspable Math API](https://github.com/eweitnauer/gm-api). The code of the games is under the MIT license, though the Graspable Math library they require to run is not.

Please contact us at contact@graspablemath.com about using GM to create and publish your own GM-based games!
